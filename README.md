``SndLib.jl`` is a Julia module to synthetise sounds for psychoacoustics experiments. This is mostly a port in progress from the [sndlib](https://github.com/sam81/pychoacoustics/blob/master/pychoacoustics/sndlib.py) library in [pychoacoustics](https://github.com/sam81/pychoacoustics).

Documentation is available [here](http://samcarcagno.altervista.org/SndLib/index.html).
